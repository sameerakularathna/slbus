<h1>Web Development Project Plan</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Identify your skills and interests:</strong>
      <p>Understand the strengths and weaknesses of your team. This will help you identify what tasks you can handle in-house and what might need to be outsourced.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Understand the Project Requirements:</strong>
      <p>Clearly define the scope of the project. In your case, you need a responsive web application with a seat booking system. Identify all the features that the system should have.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Plan the Website Structure and Layout:</strong>
      <p>Before you start writing the code for your website, you should plan it first. What information are you showcasing? What fonts and colors are you using? Here you’ll outline a simple method that you can follow to plan out your site’s content and design.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Design the Seat Booking System:</strong>
      <p>The customer should be able to select multiple seats according to their preference. The system should ensure that no two customers can reserve the same seat.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Develop the Client-side of the Web Application:</strong>
      <p>Implement the UI design, including responsive layouts and interactive elements. Integrate front-end frameworks and libraries as needed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Develop the Server-side of the Web Application:</strong>
      <p>This will involve setting up your servers, databases, APIs, and server-side logic.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Testing:</strong>
      <p>Rigorous testing is crucial. This includes unit testing, integration testing, functional testing, and usability testing.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Deployment:</strong>
      <p>After testing, you can deploy your website. You’ll need to choose a hosting service and set up your domain.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Maintenance:</strong>
      <p>Post-deployment, you’ll need to regularly update your website and fix any bugs or issues that come up.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

 <h1>Agile Development Process</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Product Backlog Creation:</strong>
      <p>As the project administrator, you should work with the project manager to create a product backlog. This is a list of all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to be made to the product during the development process.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sprint Planning:</strong>
      <p>The project manager will lead a sprint planning meeting at the start of each sprint. The team (front-end developer, back-end developer, and tester) will decide on the amount of work they believe they can complete from the product backlog.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sprint:</strong>
      <p>The team will work on the tasks decided during the sprint planning. The front-end developer will work on the user interface, while the back-end developer will work on server-side functionalities. The tester will work alongside to ensure each feature is working as expected.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Daily Stand-up:</strong>
      <p>The project manager will conduct daily stand-up meetings to discuss what was done the previous day, what will be done today, and any obstacles in the way.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sprint Review:</strong>
      <p>At the end of each sprint, the team will demonstrate the work completed during the sprint to the project manager and administrator.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sprint Retrospective:</strong>
      <p>The team will meet to discuss what went well, what didn’t, and how processes could be improved for the next sprint.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Next Sprint Planning:</strong>
      <p>Based on the review and retrospective, the project manager will lead the next sprint planning.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
